Team Subsistence
Assignment 3 Report

Where we succeeded
==================
- Networking is reliable and accurate with little to no noticable desync.
- Solved the problem of deleting and rebuilding objects like ogres and projectiles by moving
  them out of view and recycling when they are spawned.
- User-friendly GUI that is simple and easy to navigate.
- Created the game we planned to make from the beginning.
- Software architecture is seperated in classes, making it easy to extend or modify without
  too much restructuring.
- We enjoy playing our own game.

Where we fell short
===================
- We did not have time to add upgrades to gameplay or more interesting features such as competitive play.
- We could have added more polish, such as more sounds, better models, and better textures.
- The physics still acts strangely, with bullets knocking ogres into some trajectory instead
  of having them disappear.
- There are a few problems in networking where there are slight slowdowns and jittering of
  ships.
- Physics/rendering is not paused when in a menu.
- TutorialApplication holds more substantially more code than the other classes, so some more
  seperation of code could have been done.
